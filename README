at least 6 functions, each of which is achieved through a database call. 10 point BONUS: Add a 7th, complex function

There must be at least 6 functions that use the database, at least 3 of which modify the table contents in some way (i.e., add, insert, delete, or modify) and at least one of which combines information from multiple tables to produce the resulting web page. 


code / tech stack does not matter

Relational DB with 3 tables
Website with 7 functions
   CRUD team
   CRUD game
   CRUD result
   CRUD player
   view all teams
   view all results per team
   view all results on date

Home page
Navigation buttons

all commands execute from /home/krs028/public_html as www-data user

Tables:
   Team: ID, Name, Mascot, TournamentSeed
   Player: ID, TeamID, Name, Position
   Game: ID, HomeTeamID, AwayTeamID, CourtNumber, Date
   Result: GameID, HomeScore, AwayScore



steps:
use php to write website. Anytime I need data, call database() to fetch

write the database api to contain high level database functions such as
   get_teams
   get_roster
   get_games_on_date
   etc.

test these on the command line






SELECT
   TEAM.NAME,
   GAME.HOME_TEAM_ID AS HOME,
   GAME.AWAY_TEAM_ID AS AWAY,
   GAME.COURT_NUM AS CourtNumber,
   GAME.DATE AS Date,
   RESULT.HOME_TEAM_SCORE AS HomeScore,
   RESULT.AWAY_TEAM_SCORE AS AwayScore
FROM TEAM
INNER JOIN GAME
INNER JOIN RESULT
WHERE
   TEAM.ID = '1'
   AND (GAME.AWAY_TEAM_ID = TEAM.ID OR GAME.HOME_TEAM_ID = TEAM.ID)
   AND RESULT.GAME_ID = GAME.ID;
